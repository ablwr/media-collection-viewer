# Media Collection Viewer

Early WIP!

Demo is [live](http://bits.ashleyblewer.com/media-collection-viewer/index.html)

## Description

Upload a mediainfo.json (`mediainfo ~/path/to/audiovideo/files/* --Output=JSON > mediainfo.json`) to get charts that provide you with a high-level overview of your collections.

**WIP -- Only one chart so far! ðŸ˜…**

## Charts

- [x] How many tracks are in each file?
- [] What kind of formats?
- [] What kind of audio codecs?
- [] What kind of video codecs?
- [] What are the duration outliers (videos very short or very long)?
- [] What are the dimensions?
- [] What are the color spaces?
- [] What are the bit depths (color)?
- [] What are the bit dephts (audio)?
- [] Which files have timecodes?
- [] Standard? (NTSC, PAL, Other)
- [] Any files in which audio duration and video duration differ?

## TODO list

âœ” Test uploaded JS can roundtrip through WASM to Rust and back to browser  
âœ” Build JSON in Rust to send to browser  
âœ” Build chart out of delivered JSON  
- refactor!
- cleaner delivery of JS objects to charts
- utilize 'about' page
- implement json fields for Tracks
- investigate other visualization options -- not totally sold on chart.js, a rust library would be cool!
- See src/routes/home.rs for additional features/charts to build out after proof of concept has been tested
- Move TODOs to Issues tracker
