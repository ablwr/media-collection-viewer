# Media Collection Viewer

Early WIP!

Demo is [live](http://bits.ashleyblewer.com/media-collection-viewer/index.html)

## Description

Upload a mediainfo.json (`mediainfo ~/path/to/audiovideo/files/* --Output=JSON > mediainfo.json`) to get charts that provide you with a high-level overview of your collections.

**WIP -- can't guarantee success! ðŸ˜…**

## Project goals

- Fast (and not fall over or freeze trying to process data)
- Sturdy (not needing a lot of assistance)
- Client-side only / no sending data anywhere (safe to use without contacting your org's lawyers)
- Deployable for free (no breaking my bank)
- Easy to use (anyone with the right data should be able to use)

## Charts

- [x] How many tracks are in each file?
- [x] What kind of formats?
- [x] What kind of audio codecs?
- [x] What kind of video codecs?
- [x] What are the bit depths (color)?
- [x] What are the bit depths (audio)?
- [x] What are the color spaces?
- [x] Standard? (NTSC, PAL, Other)
- [x] What are the dimensions?
- [ ] What are the duration outliers (videos very short or very long)?
- [ ] Which files have timecodes?
- [ ] Any files in which audio duration and video duration differ?
